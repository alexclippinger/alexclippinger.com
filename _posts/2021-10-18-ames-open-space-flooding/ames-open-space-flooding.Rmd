title: "Ames Open Space Flooding"
description: |
  Returning home from college a few years ago, I went on a hike at a local town open space only to find the trail flooded due to beaver activity. So, I created an ArcGIS Story Map to visualize the extent of the change in landscape.

This is a small side-project that I completed last year. I was curious to see the extent of flooding at one of my favorite Open Spaces in my hometown - the Town of Old Lyme Ames Open Space. 

At the time, I was in the middle of my [Graduate Certificate in GIS](https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/graduate-certificate-in-geographic-information-systems-online/) and volunteering with the [Old Lyme Land Trust](https://www.oldlymelandtrust.org/), so I wanted to test my ability to communicate technical information to a non-technical crowd. Although brief, this ArcGIS Story Map successfully demonstrated the flooding and was ultimately shared with the town Open Space Commission as an educational reference.
