This is a small side-project that I completed last year. I was curious to see the extent of flooding at one of my favorite Open Spaces in my hometown - the Town of Old Lyme Ames Open Space. At the time, I was in the middle of my Graduate Certificate in GIS and volunteering with the Old Lyme Land Trust, so I wanted to test my ability to communicate technical information to a non-technical crowd. Although brief, this ArcGIS Story Map successfully demonstrated the flooding and was ultimately shared with the town Open Space Commission as an educational reference.
