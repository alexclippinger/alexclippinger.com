Nest is very high since they rebuilt it. 6/12/21 The osprey was attacking a heron that was in the marsh and not that close to the nest. it was dive bombing the heron and then proceeded to chase it in the air. My assumption is that there must be eggs or babies in the nest. It is hard to see due to the nest being so large and its location. Once the heron was far enough away the osprey backed off. It was such a sight to see. 7/20/21 Male osprey is very protective of the nest area. He has been chasing away very aggressively the herons that come to feed in the marsh.

Matilda was on the nest and Ezra was on his post! 4/2/21 Matilda was the nest when I stopped by at 6:30am. Ezra was out fishing, I saw him come back into the area and he went to his post. When I was driving home from work, I checked on them too (just a slow drive by) and they were both on the post, standing very close. 4/7/21 Both Matilda and Ezra were in their nest, they were just hanging there. I saw them on the post again after work. 4/17/21 It appears that Matilda is incubating! :-) Ezra is always nearby - sweet couple! 4/19/21 Matilda has been incubating while Ezra stays very close to her. 4/25/21 Matilda is looking comfy incubating and Ezra went out fishing. There were a couple of other Ospreys flying nearby, active area. 5/9/21 Pretty quiet, Matilda is incubating and Ezra was on his post, he stays close to Matilda. 5/20/21 Pretty quiet time, Matilda was incubating and Ezra was on his post. I drive by them every day (2 times) and go slow to see them and it seems that Ezra is always on his post and Matilda is incubating. I talk with Joe who lives in the house (the nest is right behind his house). He keeps me posted on the Ospreys (and any other birds that are in the marsh). 5/29/21 Matilda was standing in the nest which makes me think they have at least 1 ""baby"" I will try and talk with Joe this week, he is usually out in the yard early morning when I drive by. 5/29/21 Matilda is standing on the nest and Ezra stayed right on his post. He seems to be there most of the time though I am sure he goes out to fish. :-) 6/3/21 Saw Matilda being careful on the nest but cannot see any babies yet. I am going to check with Joe H. this week to see if he has seen them. He has a great deck that he can see into the nest. He has told me I can go up there too but I feel funny doing that when he is not home. 6/12/21 Matilda was on the nest standing and seemed to be feeding a baby. I spoke with Joe, the man who owns the home where the nest is told me he hasn't been able to see inside the nest. I walked up to the deck he has and forgot my binoculars so I couldn't really see inside the nest. I am planning to stop there this weekend, with my bins to see if I can see inside the nest. :-) I didn't see Ezra but I know he is nearby, he never goes too far from Matilda. 6/14/21 Matilda is on the nest standing and she keeps looking into the nest. I do believe she has at least 1 child and hopefully will see it or maybe 2. Ezra, as usual is sitting on his perch nearby. 7/1/21 Matilda was in the nest and I saw the kid (head) the nest is deep. Ezra was nearby on his pole, he never stays away too long. It looked like Ginger was feeding the kid. 7/7/21 I saw Matilda in the nest and I saw the kid again, she was feeding him/her. I love watching her feed him/her. Ezra wasn't there when I got there but he did arrive right as I was leaving. Joe told me that she stays with the kid most of the time and if she leaves, Ezra goes right back to the nest. Good teamwork. 7/14/21 Once again, Matilda is in the nest with the kid and Ezra was on his pole. Lots of preening going on. Ezra left and after about 20 minutes, he did come back with a fish and Matilda and the kid were happy about that. Matilda and the kid were eating their breakfast when I had to leave. 7/21/21 When I arrived, Matilda is in the nest and the kid was standing on the rim of the nest.

Two adults were observed in the area and near nest this season but the did not produce any young.

He may be helping to feed chicks?"" 6/1/21 Male was roosting on tree close to nest. He departed and flew around toward the back of the nest. Female landed on nest, restlessly  moved around, looked down into nest. Settled down in brooding posture. 06/07: Female shading chick(s) from sun and brief rain shower. The male flew by. Female got up and vocalized, then took off. She returned a couple minutes later with part of a fish. (Did she take it from male?) She ate hungrily and then gave bites to the chick(s). The male arrived and perched nearby. Then he flew away and returned. Female let male take what remained of fish. 06/08: Happened to catch female feeding a chick close to front edge of nest. I watched in hopes of seeing the chick. No such luck. 06/11: Female busy in nest. Male standing by. 06/15: Female in nest feeding barely visible chick. 6/20: Female in nest appears to be waiting for food. Chick appears, it is becoming feathered.  Male arrives with fish. 6/23: Female in nest. Later male arrived and both watch something in the nest. I assume it is a chick. 6/29/21 Female appears to be prostrate in the nest. She raises her head a little and looks at me through twigs of the nest. The chick is next to her and is vocalizing frantically. The female lowers her head. She appears to be sick. She doesn't appear able to raise her head high enough to look over the edge of the nest. I am concerned about her and come back to the nest a short time later. She stands up and moves across the nest. The chick follows her. Soon she starts feeding the chick. 06/29: Both the female and the chick are standing up in the nest when I arrive. The female departs and leaves the chick alone for about five minutes. A while later, I see her shading the chick. 8/4/21 This nest was hard to judge. The female seemed to address one chick at a time. As soon as one chick fledged, another chick came front and center and I would wonder,  what happened to the older one. I think the fledge dates are approximately 7/20, 7/26 and 8/03.

He departed and flew around toward the back of the nest. Female landed on nest, restlessly  moved around, looked down into nest. Settled down in brooding posture. 06/07: Female shading chick(s) from sun and brief rain shower. The male flew by. Female got up and vocalized, then took off. She returned a couple minutes later with part of a fish. (Did she take it from male?) She ate hungrily and then gave bites to the chick(s). The male arrived and perched nearby. Then he flew away and returned. Female let male take what remained of fish. 06/08: Happened to catch female feeding a chick close to front edge of nest. I watched in hopes of seeing the chick.

The chick is next to her and is vocalizing frantically. The female lowers her head. She appears to be sick. She doesn't appear able to raise her head high enough to look over the edge of the nest. I am concerned about her and come back to the nest a short time later. She stands up and moves across the nest. The chick follows her. Soon she starts feeding the chick. 06/29: Both the female and the chick are standing up in the nest when I arrive. The female departs and leaves the chick alone for about five minutes. A while later, I see her shading the chick. 8/4/21 This nest was hard to judge. The female seemed to address one chick at a time. As soon as one chick fledged, another chick came front and center and I would wonder,  what happened to the older one. I think the fledge dates are approximately 7/20, 7/26 and 8/03.

There appears to be a simple wood nesting box.  From street level it looks like a slat of wood, askew and somewhat windblown.  I have visited nest 51 several times prior to today and wasn't hopeful because there is only sparse nesting material.  However this afternoon I was delighted to see a lone osprey sitting up there, just looking around.  During my time observing I did not see another adult. 4/3/21 Didn't have time to look - driving by - but I definitely saw one bird go to the nest then immediately fly away.  I thought I saw another sitting on the nest.  I think it was a fish drop off for Mom. 4/5/21 Mom and Dad are indeed together.  One remained on the nest (Mom?) and the other (Dad?) remained perched on a nearby utility pole. 4/14/21 Visited around 5:30 p.m.  Mom was seated on the nest and Dad hovering nearby.  He jumped on her back and mated, then they both flew to another lighting post.  Dad left to hunt and Mom flew around to stretch her wings, circling within eyeshot of the nest. A baseball game with PA announcing began during her rest break and she was not happy about it! 4/27/21 I assume Mom on the nest, sitting still.  Dad did not make an appearance during my observation. They have been busy building up the nest since my last visit, including what appeared to be an article of clothing or some kind of bag. 5/4/21 Unless Mom is hunkered down incubating and I could not see her from street level, there were no osprey in the vicinity.  In fact I often drive by this nest in my daily routines and have not noticed any activity at all in passing this past week. 5/9/21 I'm sorry to report that this nest must be abandoned.  On this observation I saw red winged blackbirds flying in and out of the nesting material.  According to my prior visits, the osprey left the nest before the egg laying time. 6/15/21 Well this is a surprise!  I had reported the nest abandoned in May or late April?  Last week I began to see the nest getting larger and next day saw a bird sitting on it.  While driving by on 06/15/2021 I saw what appeared to be an osprey landing on the nest, though it could have been a gull. 6/21/21 I went back with binoculars and sat for 15 minutes or so.  It is indeed an osprey sitting on the nest.  During my time visiting, I did not observe a mate in the area.  The nest has several house sparrows that set up residence in it, too.  It has been built up a little higher.  All very curious because the couple left before the egg laying time and now one is back after chicks in other nests have been born and are growing. ??? 6/27/21 This time I did see the mate, he was just departing the nest when I arrived.  My last couple of drive-bys, Mom has been standing more than sitting.  I could not see a nestling today, but from Mom's behavior (standing and ducking her head down repeatedly) she appeared to be stripping fish and feeding a baby or babies.  7/6/21 Groton 51 appears to be thriving.  I visited for about five minutes and see Mom in her usual area of the last month, standing toward the side of the nest.  I still cannot see any chick(s), but this nest is very high up. 7/12/21 When I arrived the parents were actively vocalizing as one flew off and the other stayed.  Mom seemed to be stripping and feeding fish again.  I still cannot clearly see a chick, but when Mom was standing at the edge of the nest I could detect some movement farther in back. 7/14/21 I went back to confirm if there is a chick.  There was a lot of chattering coming from the nest and indeed I could see one little head popping up.  Parent was circling, sometimes out of sight, but coming back to vocalize to the chick. 8/1/21 At first I could see no occupants, then one bird stood up and began flapping while standing.

Both left to sit in a nearby tree. 4/10/21 Observed the adult male building the nest, flying out to get branches, then bringing them back to weave in.  No other adult seen nearby.  There is a platform within sight with a nesting pair (#42). The first to arrive on March 27 was a young male who began adding to the nest started by a female last year on this dead pine tree. About a week later he attracted a female to the nest and they seemed to mate.  The couple, however, relocated to the platform across the marsh (Guilford #42). A new young male arrived soon thereafter and began adding to the nest.  He, too, attracted a female, and the two seem to have settled in, constantly tending to the nest and bringing fish to eat either in the nest or on branches of the tree.  They are occasionally challenged by other males, but have been successful in defending the nest. 4/28/21 The pair has tried mating several times.  They continue to build and line the nest.  Occasionally they’ve had to fend off a third osprey (most likely male).  They are sometimes away from the nest for hours (often perched across the marsh on trees or posts), and are not currently spending the night in the nest. 5/3/21 The female is now spending most of her time in the nest, which suggests that she may have laid one or more eggs.  She also sits in the incubation posture a good deal of the time.  I cannot directly see the eggs from my vantage point, though.  The male also brought a fish this morning which they both ate. 5/6/21 (view nest every day) The osprey couple almost certainly have egg(s), though eggs are not directly visible from my vantage point.  In the last three days they have been taking turns sitting in the incubating position and one of them spends the night in the nest. They have also been mating. 5/14/21 Male and female continue to take turns to incubate, the female doing at least 70% of the share.  The nest seems too small for both ospreys to sit together for more than a few minutes.  I wonder if this will be a problem when the chicks arrive. 5/20/21 Incubation continues.  The ospreys are troubled by lawn mowing and other human activity in the vicinity, occasionally taking off for short periods.  This morning the female chased away a third osprey while the male incubated in the nest. 6/6/21 The ospreys continue to incubate, withstanding both rain and hot weather.  They have continued to add more material to the nest, including pieces of nylon fishing nets and plastic bags.  The eggs should hatch around June 10.  The nest seems not wide enough to accommodate both parents, and May be cramped when the chicks arrive. 6/13/21 Though the well of the nest is not visible from my vantage point, there are signs that at least one egg has hatched.  The ospreys seem to be fussing with the nest more than usual, though the female still spends some time in the incubation posture.  It has been over 40 days since the female first began sitting in the incubation posture.  My best guess is that while the first egg has hatched, there is at least one more that is still being incubated. 6/17/21 Though the nestling(s) are not yet visible, there is little doubt that at least one has arrived.  Though it is often the male who brings in the fish, the feeding of the nestling(s) is done almost entirely by the female.  The ospreys still spend considerable time in the incubating position, suggesting that there is still at least one more I hatched egg. 6/29/21 It is with sadness that I report the loss of all nestlings in the nest.  As far as I can tell, the first was lost about three days ago.  The ospreys seemed frantic and the female was issuing a different call (chirps repeated with greater frequency than usual).  I saw one nestling still moving in the nest about two days ago and the mother trying to feed it.

Cannot be sure the individuals belong to this particular nest, as there are a few other active nests near by. 5/2/21 Both adults were seated outside of the nest for the duration of my observation. There was one other adult circling area and the individuals of this nest were on high alert and doing territorial displays. Neither adult was incubating. One flew off to forage near Cedar Island, but returned quickly to the post next to nest. 5/10/21 Pair both on nest. One incubating one edge of nest.stayed on nest for duration of visit. 5/17/21 1 adult incubating. Observed 1 adult fly off towards Cedar Islands and returned periodically with food. 5/31/21 1 adult was posted on nest, not in incubating position.

Can barely see her head peeking up. Male nearby. 6/15 Finally see Female. She is on edge of nest with head inside. I assume there are hatchlings. Dad is perched nearby. 6/26 Female appeared to be feeding chicks. Can not yet see them. Dad was perched nearby, came to the nest for a few moments, then went back to perching. 7/6/21 Mom on edge of nest. Finally saw one chick's head. 8/10/21 Male was feeding juvenile. He took off with fish when he heard another osprey call, then promptly returned next to nest to eat some of the fish. Then he returned to nest to continue to feed the juvenile. After feeding, the adult male flew to a perch next to nest. So far I have only seen the one juvenile.","active nest, 3 young"

The one with the two adults is on a shorter platform."" 5/9/21 Believe we saw one adult on the nest, could only get glimpse of very top of head.  Still don't have a powerful enough scope.  No other activity observed. 5/13/21 One osprey was on the nest and 4 were in the air.  Wheelers Marsh is a big hangout spot for ospreys! 5/19/21 This area always has ospreys in the air, on the ground, and on piers.  Today this nest had one osprey on the nest, and six others in the immediate vicinity. 5/26/21 One osprey was on the nest and six osprey were in the immediate area.  This marsh area is perfect for osprey! 6/2/21 There was one osprey on the nest and several others flying nearby and on the ground.  I believe a pair of osprey has a nest on the ground not far from Milford #20. 6/12/21 incubating 6/18/21 One osprey was on the nest, I couldn't be sure if it was incubating.  Two other osprey were flying over and around the marsh. 7/6/21 Both adults were on the edge of the nest with one chick clearly visible.  There seemed to be other movement in the nest but I can only confirm one chick at this time. 7/26/21 1 adult was on the nest with 3 juveniles (it was a very crowded nest!).  There were several other adults flying over the marsh. 8/5/21 All 3 juveniles were missing from the nest and were probably flying nearby, there were 5 osprey flying or perched in the area.","active nest, lay date by 4/28/20, hatch date by 6/3/20, 3 fledglings.

No male in view, no food calling. 7/27/21 Female standing in nest, chick on her right eating on own. Male flies in with a stick. 8/13/21 Mom in nest most of time but have not seen chick in 6 days. Conceivable that has fledged but fledges return to nest to be fed for a period of time after fledging as have to learn to fish and that skill is not immediate normally. Hoping that am just not at nest at right time. Will follow. 8/18/21 Thank goodness, the female fledge is back in the nest, is food calling intermittently but crop is over flat.",

Did not notice if he was bringing a stick or taking a stick, but the nest already has plenty of material. 4/3/21 One adult standing watch next to the nest. Nest appears to have plenty of nesting material and, sadly, a lot of plastic. Hope the female arrives soon and tidies it up. 4/6/21 Male was eating non-stop, while female kept up the ""invitation to mate"" call. Once the male had finished eating, they mated, then both took off. There's a piece of plastic stuck in the nest that worries me, but there was a big piece of garbage bag hanging off the side last year, and it didn't seem to bother them. Maybe this isn't in the way for incubation and hatchlings. 4/20/21 It appears there are two pairs competing for this nest, even though North Haven #11, a perfectly good platform on the other side of the highway, is unoccupied. I saw one pair mating twice; the same pair, or the other pair, were mating over a week ago. And I saw one bird leave the nest to chase away another, then not too long after that all 4 birds were in the air around the nest. No bird was ever in incubation position, even though one pair was observed to mate several days ago. 4/20/21 adult on nest in incubation posture. 5/2/21 adult on nest in incubation posture.  5/14/21 both adults on nest; in incubation posture. 6/20/21 Adult waiting for dinner delivery, no longer in incubation position.

Did not notice if he was bringing a stick or taking a stick, but the nest already has plenty of material. 4/3/21 One adult standing watch next to the nest. Nest appears to have plenty of nesting material and, sadly, a lot of plastic. Hope the female arrives soon and tidies it up. 4/6/21 Male was eating non-stop, while female kept up the ""invitation to mate"" call. Once the male had finished eating, they mated, then both took off. There's a piece of plastic stuck in the nest that worries me, but there was a big piece of garbage bag hanging off the side last year, and it didn't seem to bother them. Maybe this isn't in the way for incubation and hatchlings. 4/20/21 It appears there are two pairs competing for this nest, even though North Haven #11, a perfectly good platform on the other side of the highway, is unoccupied. I saw one pair mating twice; the same pair, or the other pair, were mating over a week ago. And I saw one bird leave the nest to chase away another, then not too long after that all 4 birds were in the air around the nest. No bird was ever in incubation position, even though one pair was observed to mate several days ago. 4/20/21 adult on nest in incubation posture. 5/2/21 adult on nest in incubation posture.  5/14/21 both adults on nest; in incubation posture. 6/20/21 Adult waiting for dinner delivery, no longer in incubation position.

Given the hatchling's very young age and the height and bulk of the nest, we were able to confirm two hatchlings.  There could be a third, but maybe not. They need to grow a little more. Male at one point flew off, and divebombed a nearby heron that was minding its own business.  I hadn't seen that behavior before.  several minutes later, male returned with half a fish. 6/20/21 Confirmed 3 hatchlings!!  Female at nest with babies, male came in, and female began feeding the kids.  it was a good hunk of fish, lots of stringy guts that baby osprey prefer.   Male had to take off a few times to shoo off a few bachelor osprey in the area. Later, for the first time that we saw, female left the nest for a little while, male stayed at the nest until her return. 6/26/21 All looking good.  Nestlings are growing fast! 7/11/21 both male and female.  a good looking fish dinner spread out and shared amongst the kids.  3 Juvies are getting bigger by the day. 8/1/21 Mom and three large nestlings hanging out, awaiting Dad to come home from the office with dinner.  Nestlings are large, an have a good full set of feathers.  They will fledge any day now. 8/6/21 Female at nest.  All 3 nestlings have fledged!!!  It must have been in the past day or two.  They were basically hopping up into flight, not going very far, practicing take off and landing.  Female there to observe.  Male not in the immediate area.  Probably gone fishing.   Each Juvy took turns. 8/14/21 Two fledged juvies at the nest.  both adults and third juvy out and about.","active nest. arrival date by 3/2/6/20, lay date by 4/19/20, hatch date by 6/14/20, 2 fledglings by 7/26/20"

I didn't see him again before I left (had to get to work). The kids stayed in the nest. 2 fledglings 8/15/21 nest empty.  Although i didn't see them, I assume that the two in the nest have fledged.  They looked very healthy and ready to go last I saw them.",

It appears that a male has, only today, landed on this nest.  We believe it is a male because there don't seem to be any markings around its chest.  Osprey was sitting on the nest for most of observation time, and then flew. I am unsure if this is the usual osprey that has been at this nest over the last few years.  That male suffered injury when caught in fishing line in 2019, and was unreliably here over the last two years.  This osprey appears to be younger than last years' occupants. 4/14/21 At the start of observation, the pair was together on the nest.  Soon after, one flew off, and the other followed.  One quickly returned to the nest, and the other was seen circling the area of the water, possibly looking for food.  The other remained alone in the nest, and the osprey over the water continued to circle and hover high and low through most of the observation. 5/4/21 Observed one osprey in nest who was sitting low.  Another osprey joined this one with something that might have been food, but I think the osprey dropped most of it on the way to the nest.  A different type of bird had been observed trying to steal it.  Second osprey then left nest to sit on the nearby perch.  First osprey sitting in nest flew off, leaving nest empty!  Osprey on the perch left the perch, and went to the nest to resume low sitting position.  It's as if they are taking turns watching over nest and possible eggs.  First osprey returns. On June 2, 2021 I observed both male and female activity at the nest.  The female was sitting low in the nest as the male arrives with food.  She took a piece of the food and flew to perch some feet away.  She began tearing at food and spent time eating.  The male moved into position in the nest and sat low in there while she ate at the perch.  What I also observed was that there are many small birds who seem to have taken up residence in the bottom of the nest.  At one point, I witnessed the female in the nest removing something with her beak from the nest, and tossed it away.  This item was a small bird which landed on the squirrel guard and eventually flew away.  Today, June 4, 2021, the female is again sitting low in the nest, looking around.  I do not see the male anywhere.Yesterday, June 11th, there was a bustling of activity at the nest between the male and the female.  Both of them were in the nest together, bending, looking down, and carefully moving around.  They were primping and looking into the nest for a long time.  It is likely that the eggs have hatched, though we cannot see any tiny heads yet.  Today, June 12th, the female is in the nest alone, carrying on with similar activity.  YAY!!  Maybe this will be a great year! 6/22/21 At least TWO babies were observed on the nest today!!!  Both adults were also on the nest.  One osprey was feeding the nestlings who kept bobbing up and down to receive food.  A beautiful sight to see! 6/28/21 Observed adults on nest and realized today that there are THREE nestlings!!!  7/27/21 One adult was on the nest with two juveniles.  In the last couple of weeks, only two young osprey have been observed.  Initially there had been three noted.  One of the juveniles was stretching its wings today.  I have so far not observed any 'helicoptering' or flying by these two juveniles, but it is only a matter of time before it happens. 8/15/21 Adult was on the nest.  Juveniles were observed flying short distances around the nest, under the watchful eye of the adult. This behavior persisted for the full time we observed.

Even as of 7/20 could not make out any nestlings and never saw feeding activity, but one adult was always at or near nest. These nestlings are smaller than most of my other ones and maybe got a bit of a late start. 8/9/21 1 of the 2 juveniles have fledged. One juvenile still on nest with one adult, coming back occasionally.","active nest, arrival date by 4/4/20, lay date by 4/20/20"

It may be hidden by Mom or other nestlings. I was getting ready to leave when I spotted a bird on the sandbar at the nest. Closer look it appeared to be an Osprey chick. The tide was rolling in and the chick was crawling further up the sandbar. I called another Osprey Steward who is a rescue transporter to see who to call. Friend is coming. I flagged down two kayakers who were near nest. Husband rescues the chick and placed in storage hole. My friend arrived with rescue carrier. Chick was alert but very docile. Kayaker had picked it up with his bare hand. DPNC had been contacted and told us to bring  it there. Initial exam it seemed fine but very cold and wet. We spoke with Terry Shaw and we had a team to renest the chick on Tuesday/July 6. However, DPNC texted me early Tuesday morning the chick passed during the night. Now there are two chicks left.

I believe that the Ospreys from nest #49 are having trouble building their nest and have decided to use nest #27. I do not see how they can lay eggs and incubate on this tipped/ fallen nest.

I believe that the Ospreys from nest #49 are having trouble building their nest and have decided to use nest #27. I do not see how they can lay eggs and incubate on this tipped/ fallen nest. Not sure how this will end up as this pair seems to have started on nest #49. Also this fallen nest is prey to predators. 4/30/21 osprey on the nest. 4/30/21 Walked down track to observe this nest. This is the one that fell over. AF sitting on this fallen nest. At one time I saw three other Ospreys flying in area. I think one belongs to this nest and the other two belong to Nest #49 Amtrak. 5/12/21 AF on tipped nest. They have build it up nicely. Soon AM arrived both stood on nest and continued staying there. 5/27/21 AF on nest built on tipped over pole in incubation posture. No sign of AM in area. 6/1/21 She was happily incubating as we observed. 6/27/21 One flew off to nearby tree vocalizing-no sign of young. 7/7/21 Osprey observed on nest. No sign of other Osprey. No sign of chicks. This is the tipped over nest not sure of it's status. 7/23/21 AF sitting on nest and juvenile laying on nest. Other Osprey flying around. One dove into water but no fish. 1 fledgling. 8/4/21 Two Ospreys flying around - finally an adult landed on tipped nest. It took off; flew around and returned. Took off and I spotted it with a fish shortly; it flew to other side of island. Finally spotted on a branch in woods. Soon also spotted the fledgling with him/her together on branch. Both stayed there. 8/10/21 and 8/16/21 1 fledgling 8/17/21 No sign of either adult or Fledgling seen before around.",active nest

Female is mostly in nest and male is bringing more materials to fortify the nest. Noticed a third osprey close to the couple in the football field and will have to investigate. On 5/2 around 8:35 am the couple is still at nest, female stays while male continues to bring building material. Around 9:15 am I watched them mate twice. No leg bands that I can see yet using scope and binoculars. The nest is very substantial and the male delivered some large pieces of wood. Impressive. The third osprey is still there and I can see he is trying to build a nest about 50-75 yards away from the couple on another light tower. I assume that this may be a result of the disappearance of Nest #4 due to construction around the high school. They are not thrilled by his close proximity and the male from nest #1 is swooping by occasionally to thwart his efforts. The poor guy has not made much progress with his nest. A fourth osprey, another female sat with him for a while, but then flew away.  5/10/21 ""On this evening a little after 5 pm the male was sitting in the nest while the female was outside the nest preening and cleaning her talons for at least 10 minutes.  Then the male got up and flapped his wings a few times and then the female flapped her wings and he flew over to her, mounted her and then he flew off. After that she returned the spot in the nest. I suspect eggs are there and they are taking turns incubating. Returned on the morning of May 16 at 10 a.m. Both adults are still in incubation mode. The male flew off a few times but did not return with any fish that I saw. I also noticed a third osprey who is still trying to build a nest on another light tower in the football field. He has still not made much progress."" 6/6/21 Arrived in the morning to find one adult in nest and then saw another adult fly to a light tower nearby. No fish delivered to nest so I don’t think babies are on board yet. I had to drive to other side of nest to see the other adult osprey on the light tower. It was a female busy preening so I surmise that the adult in nest is the male who was taking over incubation duties. Hoping to see little heads soon. 6/25/21 This morning both adults were sitting in the nest. One bird appeared to be eating but it was difficult to determine if it was actually feeding young ones. The nest is very deep so I have not been able to see any tiny heads yet. ""On 7/10 around 8:45 am I finally saw the little heads appear and a little wing flapping as well. I definitely saw two and thought that there may be a third. Mom did some light housekeeping and moved some branches around the eyrie to make more space. Dad was there, too. All is well.Returned on 7/17 at 4 pm with some new gadgets. Was able to take some videos and confirm that there are three nestlings. Mom was sitting at the edge of the nest and I saw two little heads pop up. Dad flew in with a fish, gave it to mom and the sat at the edge to keep watch while she fed the young. Only in the video could I see that there were three chicks in this eyrie. All chicks seem healthy and alert.""

No fish delivered to nest so I don’t think babies are on board yet. I had to drive to other side of nest to see the other adult osprey on the light tower. It was a female busy preening so I surmise that the adult in nest is the male who was taking over incubation duties. Hoping to see little heads soon. 6/25/21 This morning both adults were sitting in the nest. One bird appeared to be eating but it was difficult to determine if it was actually feeding young ones. The nest is very deep so I have not been able to see any tiny heads yet. ""On 7/10 around 8:45 am I finally saw the little heads appear and a little wing flapping as well. I definitely saw two and thought that there may be a third. Mom did some light housekeeping and moved some branches around the eyrie to make more space. Dad was there, too. All is well.Returned on 7/17 at 4 pm with some new gadgets. Was able to take some videos and confirm that there are three nestlings. Mom was sitting at the edge of the nest and I saw two little heads pop up. Dad flew in with a fish, gave it to mom and the sat at the edge to keep watch while she fed the young. Only in the video could I see that there were three chicks in this eyrie. All chicks seem healthy and alert.""

Male comes to nest to mate but is often to be seen on favorite roosts (based on last year's behavior). 3/27/21 Both Osprey are back. At first the female was in the nest and the male was in a favorite nearby tree. They always sit at the very top of this tree which is leafless and dead looking. The male the flew back to the nest and mounted the female for a few seconds. Eventually she push him off and he flew away, maybe for food or sticks. 4/19/21 There was a workman directly below the nest cutting wood for a fence. This made me a bit nervous that our osprey may not feel comfortable there but as I pulled away I noticed the male preening in the back of their favorite pine tree. He looked beautiful and was keeping watch. He flew off and as I was leaving I noticed the female fly in with a stick. She seems very preoccupied with readying the nest. All was well. 4/29/21 It appears the female is nesting and is hard to see. She is in the nest down low and dead center. The male was across route one behind Dunkin Donuts in a favorite tree, preening and looking very proud. All is well. 5/1/21 Female incubating in center of nest. No sign of the male. 5/16/21 The adult female was taking a break in a very close tree. Because the nest is high it was hard to tell if the male was incubating in her place but he most likely was. All seemed well. 5/25/21 At first there was just a small view of a white head on the nest. Then adult feathers were visible as the female shifted in the nest. The male flew in carrying a stick and stayed for a moment. He then flew to the pine tree next to the nest and sat in the sun, observing and calling for the next 30 minutes. The female was turned inward and tending to the center of the nest leading this observer to believe that chicks may be here or starting to arrive. Small faint peeps were heard as well. 6/15/21 Two silhouettes spotted from a distance along with an adult. Upon closer viewing two small chicks confirmed with one adult on the nest with them. This nest is up high and these two nestlings are just big enough to peek over the edge to look outward and be observed clearly. There was no feeding at this moment but the adult was facing outward protecting the nest and possibly waiting for a fish from the mate. 6/27/21 There are 3 chicks on this nest. Two seem close in size while one seems smaller and is mostly hidden under mom. The larger two spend time further away from mom observing above the nest. 7/10/21 There are three nestlings with white tipped feathers ready to fledge soon. There is a lot of wing stretching and wing flapping. Two of the chicks were very affectionate with each other. The third was behind them. The third may be the last hatched but was also flapping wings and stretching. The adult male flew in with a fish and landed in a nearby tree. The adult female was already in the tree preening and keeping watch. The adult male called out to the nest for a long while before bringing the fish over. He had eaten some of the fish and then fed the remaining fish to the chicks. 7/24/21 When I first arrived there was one juvenile on the nest. In a nearby tree, a fledgling roosted. From nowhere (probably behind me) another fledgling arrived and landed on a tree while the first fledgeling moved to a distant tree. Eventually the nest was empty and all three juveniles were off the nest and presumably had fledged. It is difficult to tell them apart and they flew from tree to tree, continuously changing positions.

Male comes to nest to mate but is often to be seen on favorite roosts (based on last year's behavior). 3/27/21 Both Osprey are back. At first the female was in the nest and the male was in a favorite nearby tree. They always sit at the very top of this tree which is leafless and dead looking. The male the flew back to the nest and mounted the female for a few seconds. Eventually she push him off and he flew away, maybe for food or sticks. 4/19/21 There was a workman directly below the nest cutting wood for a fence. This made me a bit nervous that our osprey may not feel comfortable there but as I pulled away I noticed the male preening in the back of their favorite pine tree. He looked beautiful and was keeping watch. He flew off and as I was leaving I noticed the female fly in with a stick. She seems very preoccupied with readying the nest. All was well. 4/29/21 It appears the female is nesting and is hard to see. She is in the nest down low and dead center. The male was across route one behind Dunkin Donuts in a favorite tree, preening and looking very proud. All is well. 5/1/21 Female incubating in center of nest. No sign of the male. 5/16/21 The adult female was taking a break in a very close tree. Because the nest is high it was hard to tell if the male was incubating in her place but he most likely was. All seemed well. 5/25/21 At first there was just a small view of a white head on the nest. Then adult feathers were visible as the female shifted in the nest. The male flew in carrying a stick and stayed for a moment. He then flew to the pine tree next to the nest and sat in the sun, observing and calling for the next 30 minutes. The female was turned inward and tending to the center of the nest leading this observer to believe that chicks may be here or starting to arrive. Small faint peeps were heard as well. 6/15/21 Two silhouettes spotted from a distance along with an adult. Upon closer viewing two small chicks confirmed with one adult on the nest with them. This nest is up high and these two nestlings are just big enough to peek over the edge to look outward and be observed clearly. There was no feeding at this moment but the adult was facing outward protecting the nest and possibly waiting for a fish from the mate. 6/27/21 There are 3 chicks on this nest. Two seem close in size while one seems smaller and is mostly hidden under mom. The larger two spend time further away from mom observing above the nest. 7/10/21 There are three nestlings with white tipped feathers ready to fledge soon. There is a lot of wing stretching and wing flapping. Two of the chicks were very affectionate with each other. The third was behind them. The third may be the last hatched but was also flapping wings and stretching. The adult male flew in with a fish and landed in a nearby tree. The adult female was already in the tree preening and keeping watch. The adult male called out to the nest for a long while before bringing the fish over. He had eaten some of the fish and then fed the remaining fish to the chicks. 7/24/21 When I first arrived there was one juvenile on the nest. In a nearby tree, a fledgling roosted. From nowhere (probably behind me) another fledgling arrived and landed on a tree while the first fledgeling moved to a distant tree. Eventually the nest was empty and all three juveniles were off the nest and presumably had fledged. It is difficult to tell them apart and they flew from tree to tree, continuously changing positions. They were wobbly, looking downward often while they sat on branches and tested out their wings while remaining still. There are two older and stronger juveniles in this nest and a third that is often in the background. They called out to each other quite a bit. 8/17/21 After many visits at different times on different days, we believe 3 fledglings have successfully fledged. 8/18/21 has three fledglings.

Almost impossible to tell if there is any activity unless watched over time. Next visit plan to part and keep watch. Two workmen said they see osprey flying in the area frequently but unsure if they are using this nest. It is in good shape and looks well kept. My son and I went back to the nest between 4:00 and 5:00. We watched one adult flying to and from the nest bringing back sticks. This nest is active. 5/1/21 One adult flew in several times with stick. A second was seen flying away from nest as well. Not sure if this was a pair or competition. A nearby watcher reported that they have been working to rebuild the nest since it was blown off the tower in a storm. It could be that they are behind other pairs in their egg laying because of this. 5/16/21 The male was beneath the nest perched on one of the rails of the tower. This is a favorite spot for him. He was preening and observant. No sign of his mate. Could be incubating. 5/25/21 Because of its height, this nest is a challenge to observe.

Next visit plan to part and keep watch. Two workmen said they see osprey flying in the area frequently but unsure if they are using this nest. It is in good shape and looks well kept. My son and I went back to the nest between 4:00 and 5:00. We watched one adult flying to and from the nest bringing back sticks. This nest is active. 5/1/21 One adult flew in several times with stick. A second was seen flying away from nest as well. Not sure if this was a pair or competition. A nearby watcher reported that they have been working to rebuild the nest since it was blown off the tower in a storm. It could be that they are behind other pairs in their egg laying because of this. 5/16/21 The male was beneath the nest perched on one of the rails of the tower. This is a favorite spot for him. He was preening and observant. No sign of his mate. Could be incubating. 5/25/21 Because of its height, this nest is a challenge to observe.
