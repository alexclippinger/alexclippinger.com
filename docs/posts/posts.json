In 2018, I lived on one such hill, Potrero Hill, while completing my second co-op at Alvarez & Marsal. Another unfortunate aspect of San Francisco that is seemingly unavoidable is car break-ins. However, this never seemed to be an issue in my neighborhood for the six months that I lived there. The last two blocks of my bike ride home from work were quite strenuous, so I began wondering - is there a relationship between San Francisco’s steep hills and car break-ins? This is not a unique concept: previous analysis has coined the phrase “crime doesn’t climb” in reference to this possible phenomenon.\r\nHowever, I found that there were not many thorough analyses of the effects of topography on crime in San Francisco until this year. In April 2021, Young-An Kim & James C. Wo published Topography and crime in place: The effects of elevation, slope, and betweenness in San Francisco street segments. Their study provides a robust regression analysis on the effects of elevation, slope, and “hilliness” on crime, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Due to their success, I decided to conduct my own (albeit less thorough) analysis in R, using some of the tools that I recently learned in EDS223: Spatial Analysis for Environmental Data Science\r\n\r\nA Steep San Francisco Street!\r\nCollecting Data\r\nBacked by Kim and Wo’s research and my own intuition, I formulated the following variables for my regression analysis - my dependent variable is crimes (specifically car break-ins) and my independent variables are slope, elevation, and “hilliness”, which is a measure of the overall change in elevation in the surrounding area. In addition, there are many socio-economic and demographic variables that could warrant inclusion, such as median income, land use, population/population density, race, etc. However, for the purpose of completing this in a reasonable amount of time and keeping the interpretation of results simple, I have decided to only include median income by census block.\r\nData Sources\r\nLuckily, DataSF has most of the data we need, including crime, elevation contours, and areas with high slope. In addition, I downloaded streets and census block data.\r\nVisualizing Data and relationships\r\n\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM census_blocks WHERE aland10 > 0\"\r\ncensus_blocks <- st_read(\"data/census_blocks/census_blocks.shp\", query = query)\r\n\r\n\r\nReading query `SELECT * FROM census_blocks WHERE aland10 > 0' from data source `C:\\Users\\clipp\\Documents\\UCSB\\Website\\alexclippinger.github.io\\_posts\\2021-11-02-sf-crime-and-hilliness\\data\\census_blocks\\census_blocks.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 7263 features and 14 fields\r\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.5149 ymin: 37.70813 xmax: -122.357 ymax: 37.81157\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nplot(st_geometry(census_blocks))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\ncontours <- st_read(\"data/contours/contours.shp\") \r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `contours' from data source \r\n  `C:\\Users\\clipp\\Documents\\UCSB\\Website\\alexclippinger.github.io\\_posts\\2021-11-02-sf-crime-and-hilliness\\data\\contours\\contours.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 14151 features and 4 fields\r\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.5177 ymin: 37.69998 xmax: -122.357 ymax: 37.83325\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nplot(st_geometry(contours))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nslopes_over_20 <- st_read(\"data/slopes_over_20/slopes_over_20.shp\") \r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `slopes_over_20' from data source \r\n  `C:\\Users\\clipp\\Documents\\UCSB\\Website\\alexclippinger.github.io\\_posts\\2021-11-02-sf-crime-and-hilliness\\data\\slopes_over_20\\slopes_over_20.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 28055 features and 20 fields\r\nGeometry type: POLYGON\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.5148 ymin: 37.70679 xmax: -122.3572 ymax: 37.83328\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nplot(st_geometry(slopes_over_20))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nstreets <- st_read(\"data/streets/streets.shp\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `streets' from data source \r\n  `C:\\Users\\clipp\\Documents\\UCSB\\Website\\alexclippinger.github.io\\_posts\\2021-11-02-sf-crime-and-hilliness\\data\\streets\\streets.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 16995 features and 31 fields\r\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.5136 ymin: 37.70702 xmax: -122.3578 ymax: 37.83213\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nplot(st_geometry(streets))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM crime_reports_2018_present WHERE incident_2 = 'Motor Vehicle Theft'\"\r\ncrimes <- st_read(\"data/crime_reports_2018_present/crime_reports_2018_present.shp\", query = query)\r\n\r\n\r\nReading query `SELECT * FROM crime_reports_2018_present WHERE incident_2 = 'Motor Vehicle Theft'' from data source `C:\\Users\\clipp\\Documents\\UCSB\\Website\\alexclippinger.github.io\\_posts\\2021-11-02-sf-crime-and-hilliness\\data\\crime_reports_2018_present\\crime_reports_2018_present.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nreplacing null geometries with empty geometries\r\nSimple feature collection with 24858 features and 28 fields (with 315 geometries empty)\r\nGeometry type: POINT\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.5113 ymin: 37.70799 xmax: -122.3637 ymax: 37.82999\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\r\n\r\nshow\r\n\r\nplot(st_geometry(crimes))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModel\r\nCreate a simple regression model, show equation and results.

Notably, 2020 saw a decrease in stewards and fledglings observed due to difficulties with participation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nOspreys in Connecticut\r\n\r\nOspreys in Essex Land Trust.\r\nAccording to the CT DEEP, the osprey population in Connecticut reached a record low of only 9 active nests in 1974. The population suffered from pressure due to coastal development and DDT contamination causing eggshell thinning. Since the banning of DDT and restrictions on other pesticides in the 1970s, their population in the state has steadily been on the rise.\r\nSource: https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Wildlife/Fact-Sheets/Osprey\r\nOspreys in Old Lyme, CT\r\nFor this blog, I am looking at the town of Old Lyme, CT. This is for a few reasons…\r\nOld Lyme is my hometown!\r\n~10% of nests in the state are found in the town’s coastline and rivers.\r\nGreat Island and the Lower Connecticut River Valley area are important ecological and conservation areas. The CT Audobon reports that the greatest concentration of Osprey nests in the state is on Great Island.\r\nOf the 231 stewards that volunteered for the project in 2020, there were 26 unique stewards who collected data in Old Lyme.\r\nTaking a look at the data:\r\nAlong with the annual report, Osprey Nation publishes data on nest locations, type, stewards, monitored status, and description.\r\nHere is the interactive data map provided on the Osprey Nation website:\r\n\r\n\r\nI downloaded the data from the map above as a .kmz file, which I loaded in QGIS. To create the subset of only Old Lyme nests, I created a buffer of the town boundary and used the Select by location tool in the QGIS Processing Toolbox. This could have also been achieved in R by filtering on the name column of the all_nests data set, since all Old Lyme nests begin with “Old Lyme”.\r\nFirst, I wanted to see how many nests were actively monitored in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my datasets, there are 958 total nests and 95 nests in Old Lyme. This plot shows that 91% of these nests in the entire state and 96% of nests in Old Lyme were actively monitored in 2020.\r\nNext, let’s look at the types of nests that exist. Looking at the data set of all 958 nests in Connecticut, there are a staggering 200 unique nest types entered by stewards (after accounting for capitalization and white space). Many of these are different ways of saying the same thing: For example, a light pole could be entered as light post, electric pole, utility pole, on a light pole, light tower, light fixture, etc. In addition, some nest types included notes, such as dates that platforms were built or “difficult to see”.\r\nInstead of re-categorizing all of these nests here, I will simply highlight the most common nest types and the need for standardization of this column in future years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot shows that platform nests are by far the most common nest type, making up ~35% of all nests. It is important to note that 191 nests had no data on nest type, representing ~20% of all nests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60 of the 95 nests in Old Lyme had no data on nest type, making up ~31% of missing nest types despite Old Lyme only holding ~10% of total nests. 19 of the 35 nests with data inputted were platforms, which is consistent with the overall data set.\r\nThe map below highlights the nests in Old Lyme with missing nest type data for potential data capture in the next year’s report:\r\n\r\nMap of Missing Nest Type Data in Old Lyme, CT.\r\nNests with missing data are spatially distributed throughout the town’s coastline. This data should be collected to allow for potential analysis of the relationship between nest type and success rates of fledglings.\r\nFinally, I want to look at the final nest status data.\r\n\r\nMap of Nest Status at the end of the 2020 Osprey season in Old Lyme, CT.\r\nThe success of the nest appears to be randomly distributed across all locations. Many sites on Great Island were left as “Active”, which indicates that a final report on fledglings was not obtained. This could be due to the difficulty of access for some of these sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plot above shows the final status of nests in Old Lyme for 2020. In all, there were 16 successful nests out of the total of 95, with 30 fledglings reported and likely more unreported. In summary, Old Lyme has ~10% of the state’s nests and yielded 0.06% of reported fledglings.\r\nFinally, here is a fun heat map of nest locations in the town:\r\n\r\nHeatmap of Nests in Old Lyme, CT.\r\nThis illustrates the density of nests on and around Great Island - which holds the most nests in one place in all of Connecticut! It is evident that this area is deserving of the conservation and appreciation that it deserves.\r\nRecommendations\r\nCritical information such as osprey arrival dates and departure dates are difficult to analyze as they are only included in a verbose “description” column. Key statistics like these should be saved in separate columns in order to be more useful for long-term insights.\r\nReflections\r\nThis was my first attempt at an independent blog post focusing on data visualization. The main difficulty was finding the time to work on this project while balancing work and graduate school! Nonetheless, I learned a lot about integrating text, plots, and maps to tell a story. In the future, I hope to improve my skills in all three of these areas. Also, I hope to make blog posts that are more interactive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
