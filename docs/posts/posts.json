    "contents": "\r\nWe are in week 3 of the MEDS program at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Here are a few things that we’ve learned…\r\nR functions:\r\nSo far, we have learned various methods of getting data into more usable formats.\r\nHere is an example of using the dplyr group_by and summarize functions…\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\r\n  species   mean_body_mass_g\r\n  <fct>                <dbl>\r\n1 Adelie               3701.\r\n2 Chinstrap            3733.\r\n3 Gentoo               5076.\r\n\r\nConcepts\r\nWe have also learned fundamental concepts for working with data. One such concept is tidy data, which refers to the following qualities: - Each column contains a single variable - Each row contains a single observation - Each cell contains a single value\r\nThis is important for other important concepts that we’ve learned, such as scientific reproducibility.\r\nTakeaways\r\nThe MEDS program has been rewarding and challenging in the initial weeks. I have learned to think critically and deliberately about every bit of code that I write. I have also appreciated the helpful and collaborative community that has formed in our small cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
