    "contents": "\nWe are in week 3 of the MEDS program at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Here are a few things that we’ve learned…\nR functions:\nSo far, we have learned various methods of getting data into more usable formats.\nHere is an example of using the dplyr group_by and summarize functions…\n\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n  species   mean_body_mass_g\n  <fct>                <dbl>\n1 Adelie               3701.\n2 Chinstrap            3733.\n3 Gentoo               5076.\n\nConcepts\nWe have also learned fundamental concepts for working with data. One such concept is tidy data, which refers to the following qualities: - Each column contains a single variable - Each row contains a single observation - Each cell contains a single value\nThis is important for other important concepts that we’ve learned, such as scientific reproducibility.\nTakeaways\nThe MEDS program has been rewarding and challenging in the initial weeks. I have learned to think critically and deliberately about every bit of code that I write. I have also appreciated the helpful and collaborative community that has formed in our small cohort.\n\n\n\n",
