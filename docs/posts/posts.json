As such, the initiative relies on volunteer stewards to monitor the vast number of nests in Connecticut, with a record 733 monitored in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Stewards collect and send in data on osprey arrival dates each spring, nest locations, nesting success, and departure dates.\r\nStewards\r\n\r\n\r\nyear\r\n\r\n\r\nstewards\r\n\r\n\r\nnests_with_data\r\n\r\n\r\nactive_nests\r\n\r\n\r\nfledglings\r\n\r\n\r\nfledlings_per_nest\r\n\r\n\r\n2014\r\n\r\n\r\n100\r\n\r\n\r\n174\r\n\r\n\r\n210\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2015\r\n\r\n\r\n146\r\n\r\n\r\n322\r\n\r\n\r\n250\r\n\r\n\r\n356\r\n\r\n\r\n0.69\r\n\r\n\r\n2016\r\n\r\n\r\n224\r\n\r\n\r\n420\r\n\r\n\r\n337\r\n\r\n\r\n490\r\n\r\n\r\n0.80\r\n\r\n\r\n2017\r\n\r\n\r\n287\r\n\r\n\r\n540\r\n\r\n\r\n394\r\n\r\n\r\n607\r\n\r\n\r\n0.89\r\n\r\n\r\n2018\r\n\r\n\r\n314\r\n\r\n\r\n603\r\n\r\n\r\n416\r\n\r\n\r\n725\r\n\r\n\r\n0.93\r\n\r\n\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\n342\r\n\r\n\r\n732\r\n\r\n\r\n501\r\n\r\n\r\n650\r\n\r\n\r\n0.81\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\n231\r\n\r\n\r\n733\r\n\r\n\r\n510\r\n\r\n\r\n549/744 estimated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table above shows the progression of the Osprey Nation project over time.

The population suffered from pressure due to coastal development and DDT contamination causing eggshell thinning. Since the banning of DDT and restrictions on other pesticides in the 1970s, their population in the state has steadily been on the rise.\r\nSource: https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Wildlife/Fact-Sheets/Osprey\r\nOld Lyme, CT\r\nFor this blog, I am looking at the town of Old Lyme, CT. This is for a few reasons…\r\nOld Lyme is my hometown!\r\n~10% of nests in the state are found in the town’s coastline and rivers.\r\nSpecifically, Great Island is an important conservation area.\r\nOf the 231 stewards that volunteered for the project in 2020, there were 26 unique stewards who collected data in Old Lyme.\r\nLet’s take a look at the data:\r\nAlong with the annual report, Osprey Nation publishes data on nest locations, type, stewards, monitored status, and description.\r\nHere is the data map provided on the Osprey Nation website:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, I wanted to see how many nests were actively monitored in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot shows that 91% of nests in the entire state and 96% of nests in Old Lyme were actively monitored in 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\nCritical information such as osprey arrival dates and departure dates are difficult to analyze as they are only included in a verbose “description” column. Key statistics like these should be saved in separate columns in order to be more useful for long-term insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here are a few things that we’ve learned…\r\nR functions:\r\nSo far, we have learned various methods of getting data into more usable formats.\r\nHere is an example of using the dplyr group_by and summarize functions…\r\n\r\n\r\nToggle Code\r\n\r\n# Example using the palmerpenguins dataset\r\npenguins_summary <- penguins %>% \r\n  group_by(species) %>% \r\n  summarize(mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))\r\n\r\npenguins_summary\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\r\n  species   mean_body_mass_g\r\n  <fct>                <dbl>\r\n1 Adelie               3701.\r\n2 Chinstrap            3733.\r\n3 Gentoo               5076.\r\n\r\nConcepts\r\nWe have also learned fundamental concepts for working with data. One such concept is tidy data, which refers to the following qualities: - Each column contains a single variable - Each row contains a single observation - Each cell contains a single value\r\nThis is important for other important concepts that we’ve learned, such as scientific reproducibility.\r\nTakeaways\r\nThe MEDS program has been rewarding and challenging in the initial weeks. I have learned to think critically and deliberately about every bit of code that I write. I have also appreciated the helpful and collaborative community that has formed in our small cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
