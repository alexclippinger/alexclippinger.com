After college, I spent the next year working in catastrophe risk modeling, where I gained exposure to the applications of data science to environmental applications. I earned a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2021 and began pursuing a career combining environmental science and data. Most recently, I was a geospatial analyst at Sentera, where I used GIS, remote sensing, and machine learning tools to analyze in-season agriculture data from drone imagery. As a Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, I hope to learn the necessary skills to take on difficult environmental challenges with an increasing demand for data-intensive solutions.\r\n              test\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              I graduated from Northeastern University in Boston, MA in 2019 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and Economics.
