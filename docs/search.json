After college, I spent the next year working in catastrophe risk modeling, where I gained exposure to the applications of data science to environmental applications. I earned a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2021 and began pursuing a career combining environmental science and data. Most recently, I was a geospatial analyst at Sentera, where I used GIS, remote sensing, and machine learning tools to analyze in-season agriculture data from drone imagery. As a Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, I hope to learn the necessary skills to take on difficult environmental challenges with an increasing demand for data-intensive solutions. \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education\r\n            Master of Environmental Data Science (Expected June 2022), Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara - Santa Barbara, CA\r\n            Graduate Certificate (April 2021), Northeastern University - Boston, MA\r\n            Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics (December 2019), Northeastern University - Boston, MA \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Interests\r\n            Data Science\r\n            Geospatial Analysis\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Alex Clippinger\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              About Me\r\n              I graduated from Northeastern University in Boston, MA in 2019 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and Economics.
