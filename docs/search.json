I graduated from Northeastern University in 2019 with a degree in Mathematics and Economics. Since then, I’ve managed risk from extreme events at AIR Worldwide, helped farmers save money using in-season agriculture insights from drone imagery at Sentera, and volunteered with the Old Lyme Land Trust to understand high priority conservation areas in my home town.\r\n            I am currently a Master of Environmental Data Science student at UCSB, where I hope to gain the necessary data science and analysis skills to support innovation and investment in sustainable practices and clean energy. I believe that economic principles, supported by data science and analytics, can be used to address the environmental challenges we now face. \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Currently\r\n            Data Scientist (Part-Time) @ RDN, Inc. \r\n            Graduate Student @ Bren School of Environmental Science & Management \r\n            Teaching Assistant @ UCSB Department of Economics\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Alex Clippinger\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              About Me\r\n              Hello!
