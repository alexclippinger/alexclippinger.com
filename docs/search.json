I am currently a Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and Economics from Northeastern University in 2019. After college, I worked in catastrophe risk modeling, where I gained exposure to the exciting applications of data science to environmental applications. xxxx While working, I earned a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2021 and began pursuing a career combining environmental science and data. Along the way, I completed projects creating an automated dashboard for Northeastern’s International Safety Office and analyzing COVID data for the Kostas Research Institute. I also volunteered with my home town land trust to create a GIS database and completed research studies to identify conservation acquisition targets. Most recently, I was a geospatial analyst where I used GIS, remote sensing, and machine learning tools to analyze in-season agriculture data from drone imagery. Through the MEDS program, I hope to\n              test\n            \n            \n              I am committed to __.
