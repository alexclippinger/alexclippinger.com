I got a glimpse of the applications of data science and the environmental challenges working as a catastrophe risk modeler. I. While working, I earned a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2021 and began pursuing a career combining environmental science and data. This began with an internship as a geospatial analyst, which provided me with experience using geospatial technologies (GIS, remote sensing, and machine learning tools) for agriculture analytics. Currently, I am a Master of Environmental Data Science student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara.
