RHESSys and other similar models are becoming increasingly sophisticated due to advances in software engineering, increased data availability, and a growing body of knowledge within the field of ecohydrology. Due to the complexity of these models, interpreting the high volume of data they output is a key challenge—both for scientists and the public. Using machine learning, researchers understanding and interpretation of model output can be enhanced and accelerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRole\r\n\r\n\r\nI collaborated with 3 peers to develop a workflow to allow researchers to quickly find patterns and relationships in RHESSys model output using machine learning tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n\r\nR (RStudio)RShinyGitHubMachine Learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary - June 2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFor my Capstone Project, I worked with the creator of The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), Dr. Naomi Tague, and the Tague Team Lab at UCSB’s Bren School.\r\nRHESSys is a GIS-based ecohydrologic model that assesses nutrient and water cycling at varying spatial scales. RHESSys is used by researchers to, among other applications, investigate climate change impacts on forest ecosystems. For example, Burke et. al 2021 explored fuel treatment effects on forest health and fires, and Peng et. al 2013 analyzed the effect of timing of precipitation and snow melt recharge on stream flow.\r\nProblem\r\nRHESSys, like other process-based models, can produce massive data sets with spatial, temporal, and non-linear variable relationships. The figure below demonstrates the complexity of the project’s case study data for the Sagehen Creek Field Station.\r\nThe goal of this project is to make it easier for researchers to quickly analyze and understand RHESSys output.\r\nThis project is currently in progress. For more information prior to completion, please see the Initial Project Proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For my project, I chose to create a graphic that would capture the personal memories and details of a backpacking trip that someone close to me completed in June of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n\r\nR (RStudio)ArcGIS ProFigma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary - March 2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData visualization of a backpacking trip along the Big Seki Loop.\r\nClick here for the full-sized image\r\nThe map was created in ArcGIS Pro using a variety of data sources, including an SRTM Digital Elevation Model and National Park Service trails, boundaries, and water bodies. The elevation line chart was created using a GPX file downloaded from CalTopo that was then processed and visualized in R. Lastly, the vast majority of the graphic design work was completed in Figma - including the trip journal, chart axes, and many finishing touches to the map (labels, linear gradients, masks, and more). I am extremely happy with the finished product!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
