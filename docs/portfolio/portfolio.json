RHESSys and other similar models are becoming increasingly sophisticated due to advances in software engineering, increased data availability, and a growing body of knowledge within the field of ecohydrology. Due to the complexity of these models, interpreting the high volume of data they output is a key challenge—both for scientists and the public. Machine learning algorithms have the capability of quantifying patterns in data that are not revealed by statistical analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRole\r\n\r\n\r\nI collaborated with 3 peers to develop and implement a reproducible machine learning algorithm that predicts climate change impact on forest health using RHESSys model output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n\r\nR (RStudio)RShinyGitHubMachine Learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary - June 2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This project is currently in progress.

For my project, I chose to create a graphic that would capture the personal memories and details of a backpacking trip that someone close to me completed in June of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n\r\nR (RStudio)ArcGIS ProFigma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary - March 2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData visualization of a backpacking trip along the Big Seki Loop.\r\nThe map was created in ArcGIS Pro using a variety of data sources, including an SRTM Digital Elevation Model and National Park Service trails, boundaries, and water bodies. The elevation line chart was created using a GPX file downloaded from CalTopo that was then processed and visualized in R. Lastly, the vast majority of the graphic design work was completed in Figma - including the trip journal, chart axes, and many finishing touches to the map (labels, linear gradients, masks, and more). I am extremely happy with the finished product!\r\nClick here for the full-sized image\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
