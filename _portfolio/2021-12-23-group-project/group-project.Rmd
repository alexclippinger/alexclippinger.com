  <h3>Background</h3>
</div>

Ecohydrologic models are core tools when investigating how climate can influence water, carbon, and energy cycles in natural and urbanizing landscapes. RHESSys and other similar models are becoming increasingly sophisticated due to advances in software engineering, increased data availability, and a growing body of knowledge within the field of ecohydrology. Due to the complexity of these models, interpreting the high volume of data they output is a key challengeâ€”both for scientists and the public. Using machine learning, researchers understanding and interpretation of model output can be enhanced and accelerated.

### Introduction

For my Capstone Project, I worked with the creator of The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), Dr. Naomi Tague, and the Tague Team Lab at UCSB's Bren School. 

RHESSys is a GIS-based ecohydrologic model that assesses nutrient and water cycling at varying spatial scales. RHESSys is used by researchers to, among other applications, investigate climate change impacts on forest ecosystems. For example, [Burke et. al 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2020.591162) explored fuel treatment effects on forest health and fires, and [Peng et. al 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrg.20073) analyzed the effect of timing of precipitation and snow melt recharge on stream flow.


### Problem

RHESSys, like other process-based models, can produce massive data sets with spatial, temporal, and non-linear variable relationships. The figure below demonstrates the complexity of the project's case study data for the Sagehen Creek Field Station.

The goal of this project is to make it easier for researchers to quickly analyze and understand RHESSys output.
