In December, I volunteered with [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) for a [DataDive](https://www.datakind.org/dec22datadive) event. During this 3-day session, I analyzed, modeled, and visualized data for [Benefits Data Trust](https://bdtrust.org/). Their mission is to identify gaps in SNAP enrollment (i.e., geographies with most potential for their team's outreach to impact enrollment). Below are the two deliverables that I completed during the volunteer event:

1. [Shiny App](https://github.com/datakind/BDT_DataDive_Dec22/tree/main/snap_participation_shiny_app): This R Shiny application dynamically displays SNAP participation as a percent of state population for each state and year in the United States.

2. [OLS Model](https://github.com/datakind/BDT_DataDive_Dec22/tree/main/notebooks/basic_ols): Baseline models to predict enrollment rates and analyze gaps in predicted enrollment.
