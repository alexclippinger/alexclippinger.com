### About Me

Hello! I graduated from Northeastern University in 2019 with a degree in Mathematics and Economics. Since then, I've managed risk from extreme events at [AIR Worldwide](https://www.air-worldwide.com/), helped farmers save money using in-season agriculture insights from drone imagery at [Sentera](https://sentera.com/), and volunteered with the Old Lyme Land Trust to understand high priority conservation areas in my home town.

I am currently a [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) student at UCSB, where I hope to gain the necessary data science and analysis skills to support innovation and investment in sustainable practices and clean energy. I believe that economic principles, supported by data science and analytics, can be used to address the environmental challenges we now face.
