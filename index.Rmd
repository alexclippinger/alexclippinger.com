### About Me

I am a [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) student at UCSB, where I am learning to apply machine learning, statistics, and data visualization to my work in environmental science. My [capstone](https://alexclippinger.github.io/portfolio/2021-12-23-group-project/index.html)  uses decision-tree-based algorithms to explore variable importance from ecohydrologic model output.
